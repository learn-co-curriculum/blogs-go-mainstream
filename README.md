  Mainstream
    - tumblr
      - everyone starts blogging
    - buzzfeed
      - leads to media companies that essentially are blogs
    - programming blogs
      - programming blogs are one of the best ways to learn and thats why were here

  Just sort of painting the picture of what the blogosphere looks like, getting stats on blog numbers and the power of them would be cool - the point is to really clinche how big of a thing you are joining when you start writing.
